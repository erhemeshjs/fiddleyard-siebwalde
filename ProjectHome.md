This project is a home automation project to control the home build fiddle yard. The source code of the Fiddle-Yard is written with the Microchip IDE combined with the Microchip C18 compiler version 3.36 (ethernet support ver 3.3 and higher).
It is programmed and running on a PIC18f97j60. It uses ethernet to communicate with a PC which runs at this time labview. The code is still under development, especially the communication part of it.

Two more projects will be added in near future, one to control the total track, and one to support mobile wireless control of the Train yard.

A video of the fiddle yard and others can be found here:
